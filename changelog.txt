/////////////////// UFH Version 0.0.0.2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\


### Integrated the following changes from HPM 0.3.8.4
-EIC minimod and INNNM minimods are basically integrated as optional minimods in the decision menu at the game start.
-Kudos for AFPG for flags for Vanuatu, Samoa, Zimbabwe, Comoros and Uganda!
-Changed the SSNP religious policy to secularism and citizenship_policy to full citizenship. Changed the Kurdish fascist party to secularized.
-Fixed a bug in event 9406 that would stop it from firing. Thanks anon!
-Corrected being able to build railways in deserts again. That was a mistake.
-Uniting Turkestan shouldn't give cores in Afghanistan anymore.
-(The Fascist party of Turkey now has limited citizenship instead of residency as a policy.)
-Changed Sitka's LR to 35 so Alaska can get immigrants.
-Made the initial wars for the UK, Russia and the Ottoman Empire to start with a "Status Quo" CB for the other side.
-Made the events for Alaska, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Newfoundland where the countries ask for independence not be exclusive to the UK. It will happen to any country that own these places.
-Made events dealing with New Zealand dynamic, so they don't happen exclusively to the UK but to anyone who owns Auckland. Made localization more generic with variables for possible countries that own the place.
-Added Pontus as a non-releasable vassal to Sinop, Giresun and Trabzon, so greek pops don't assimilate. The tag will be used later in GW dismantlements. Cores go away with population exchanges.
-Added orthodox and protestant equivalent pops in Alaska, so conversion can happen with the lowest chance of bugs.
-Renamed "Cattle" to "Livestock" and "Precious Metal" to "Precious Goods" to be more in line with the stuff it represents in game. Fixed a few localization issues in HPM/Vanilla stuff.
-Jacobins will now check if a country has Free Press, Allowed Meetings, Abolished Slavery and Serfdom, if the borders are closed and if the UH Composition is not "Appointed" or "Ruling Party Only" when deciding not to spawn.
-Jacobins should now open borders and shouldn't roll back the last level of trade unions when they win. They will also change the Upper House Composition to Proportional Representation, except in the US.
-Instead of a country getting 50 War Exhaustion when Rebels win, now a country will get 2.5 WE for each province rebels occupy. Except for Nationalist rebels.
-Socialists won't rise if they have the same reforms the Jacobins need to stop rising PLUS the last two of every social reform and All Trade Unions except Health Care, Education and Penal System. They also demand the abolition of child labor
-Jacobins and Militant socialists will not rise if they are the ruling party and the basic political and/or social reforms they demand are passed. However, if they are not the ruling party and but their demands are met, they will suffer a reduced change to spawn. That means they will try to participate in the democratic process more.
-Fixed a bug with rebels that made them glitch and appear when they shouldn't. Reworked the rebel files so it's more in line with Vanilla than NNM/PDM. Removed Uruguayan-specific rebels and integrated them in the jacobin/reactionary rebels.
-Successful Rebellions should now remove 25% of the loser's prestige (up from the previous 20%) and 30% if it's a nationalist rebellion. They will also remove -25 Plurality from the country (with Jacobins/Socialists removing -10).
-Accepted pops of a non-existing tag will now behave as primary culture pops for rebel purposes. What this means is, they will not join ideological rebels if they can join nationalistic or patriotic/separatist rebels, making independence-seeking rebels much more dangerous.
-Made so Slaves can't join Ideological rebels. They still can join nationalistic rebels though. In the future a new rebel type will be added for slaves, for the abolition of slavery.
-Fixed a bug that would allow infinite prestige by releasing and integrating the Sulu.
-Changed 1162 - Bahrain from Grain to Fruit, 1165 - Doha from Grain to Fish, 1167 - from Grain to Fruit and 2664 - Khasab from grain to Fish. To better represent the RGOs there (fruits being Date). Changed the "Trade City" decision and modifier to "Pearl Hunting", which will change the RGOs from these provinces from their original ones to "Precious Goods" from 3 to 6 months during summer. After that, the RGOs will be reverted. The whole process will be automatic and taken by the AI, so a player will only see the results.
-Changed Dubai from Grain to Fruits.
-"Gateway to a new Land" modifier in Valparaiso will now last 10 years instead of 30.
-Bahrain and Qatar will start in the Ottoman sphere.
-Changed a the decisions for claiming Togo and Namibia so the AI has an easier time doing them. Changed the Congo decision so the Swedes don't always end with the place (there's a much bigger chance of not going to anyone now) and so reading the decision requirements is easier.
-Stopped the Faroe tag from starting with a non existing party in power.
-Removed Prestige of the starting Persian generals.
-Fixed an event having a duplicate ID.
-Added an Equatorial Guinea tag to stop native pops there assimilating. Re-did pops and ownership based on http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol22num1-2/moreno.pdf The Fang won't start in the island anymore (moved there in the middle from the 20th century onwards), the island will now produce fruit instead of wool (they were big cacao producers) and both the island and the land will start with some igbo pops. The Spanish won't start owning the land and instead will have event/decision to colonize each place separately.
-Changed the way overseas assimilation works: cores in overseas provinces will now stop the assimilation of both accepted and primary cultures of that core.
-The UK shouldn't start with trinket health care anymore.
-Removed the micro "Wayuu" culture from Colombia/Venezuela. They are Amazonian now. 
-Added a Kreol culture for the islands in Africa.
-Fixed the Golden Stool event.
-Moved all "AI Cleanup" events to decisions to improve performance, made them a bit better and fixed a bug in one.
-Added the "Bulgarian Exarchate" decision for the Ottoman Empire. Thanks anon!
-Fixed the rebel icons being misaligned.
-Fixed a few instances of decisions to integrate tags that were being fired by the AI against the player when it shouldn't.
-Fixed the Navy OOB of Greece of be more in line with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Hellenic_Navy#The_Royal_Hellenic_Navy_of_King_Otto
-Fixed releasing vassals giving prestige instead of taking it.
-Added a tag for Comoros and the flags for it and Turkmeneli and Equatorial Guinea. Kudos to AFPG for the flags.
-Fixed the rotation of the port in Bristol which was stopping the port from appearing.
-Fixed a bug that was stopping Malaysia from being formed.
-Made the AI prioritize "Revolution and Counterrevolution" more so they can get "The Dark Continent" invention more consistently sooner.
-Fixed the gateway_to_harbor modifier for Tokyo lasting forever (like it was in NNM) with one event option for the "A new Capital in the East?" event.
-Made so the Emigration NF can always be used by Communist/Fascist Dictatorships.
-Armament Inventions of the Light Armament tree are now sequential. Meaning that you can only discover "Breech-loaded Armament" if you discovered "Muzzle-loaded Armament" first.
-Added the option to "Disable Bankruptcy Events" (for the player only, the AI will still get it) in the Options decisions.
-Alaska should become the primary culture of the owner once its sold, as long as the buyer is a new world culture. If Alaska is sold to the British, the culture will be Anglo-Canadian. If it's sold to Japan or if it remains on Russian hands, it will keep on being "Alaskan".
-Fixed a few old references to Saito in the files.
-Increased the population of Korea from around 9 million to around 16 million. Based on Korean History in Maps, pp 99. To compensate for that change and reflect Korea's growth, their LR was changed from 35 to 31. Kudos to anon for this.
-The Netherlands will now lose flemish as accepted when they sign the Treaty of London.
-Reduced the population of the Netherlands proper to around  ~2700000 people, based on estimates derived from "European Historical Statistics, 1750-1970 by B. R. Mitchell". The population of Limburg was increased to 317200 (79.3k pops, previously they had 41.5k pops) based on the same source. Kudos to anon for this.
-Changed the Romanian party names based on https://pastebin.com/jcwPKwLR
-Fixed the capital of Tanzania so it starts in Dar es Salaam. Fixed a few province names, made a few name changes for when the place is colonized. Fixed accepted pops for it and for all African post-colonial nations, and re-did their parties from something generic (and sometimes outright wrong) to more historical names.
-Re-did the way the "Claim" or "Reorganize" colonies decision work. Now they will try to clean native tags core and add historical cores if you own the land. Added a decision to reorganize Buganda, Botswana, Burkina Faso and Ghana. Those were missing. To organize the Niger now you actually need a province in the Niger river rather than a province in the middle of the desert.
-Added tags for Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea and Samoa. In most cases they extend to more land that they occupy in modern times. They are mostly to stop integration.
-Changed Kyrgyzstan's color so it isn't the same as Kokand.
-Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic shouldn't accept their african diaspora cultures at the start, or spanish, anymore.
-Added a decision to form the Antillean Confederation if you have Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic and have Caribeno as primary culture. An irredentist decision lets the confederation claim the rest of the (non-Spanish) Caribbean.
-Uniting with Greece as Cyprus should no longer give Greece turkish as accepted.
-Removed the naval base from Bahia Blanca in Argentina that was messing with the ability tow upgrade the base in Buenos Aires.
-To avoid the "Endless Crisis" bug introduced by patch 3.04, vassal nations will be immune to tension.
-Rhodesia isn't a releasable country anymore. It's only releasable by decision for the UK. The default colonial tag for the place is Zimbabwe. Transvaal, Oranje and Natalia aren't releasable either, since that would mean natives releasing them as uncivs. But you can play as them as you normally would through events that fire to the UK.
-Trucial States will now start as Sunni.
-Parties with pro_atheism religious policy will now deactivate the "islamic country" modifier, but they won't secularize the society.
-Removed the "native protection act" and integrated it into the new Native Policy system, where one can either accept them, assimilate or try to exterminate them.
-Belize no longer accepts British and Afro-caribbean.
-Yucatan was changed from Mexican to Maya primary. They will now only petition to join the FRCA if the FRCA enacted the Native Protection Act, have at least culture voting rights and have more than 50 relations with them.
-Reshaped province 2046 - Ujiji and 2045 - Morogoro so their shape follow the existing rivers.
-Mozambique: Reshaped Tete, Sena, Quelimane, Sofala, Inkomati, Manjakazi, Inhambane and Massekisse to follow river borders (and more historical province borders). 3 of 4 Mozambique States were reshaped to accommodate the changes.
-Reshaped Douala province in Cameroon to follow the river border.
-Ethiopia: Changed the Harari (that existed in a single province and had 4 mentions) to Habesha, to represent southern semitic-ethiopic cultures (Harari, Gurage, Silt'e, Soddo). Re-did their names. Added some to Harar (since harar didn't start with any Harari, ironically) and added a Shewa core there. Removed the Sidamo (now they are represented as cushitic) and made them animist instead of sunni. Reworked pops so they follow modern distribution better (http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Ethmap_files/Ethiopian%20languages%20large%20map.jpg) and re-did states (Gibe state was removed), so Ethiopia is now 5 states of 4 provinces each. Re-did pops in all provinces to represent demographics and distribution better.
-Added a Nilotic Culture, a Cushitic Culture. "African Minors" in the Cushitic Area (Ethiopia, Somalia and parts of Kenya) were changed to this culture. African Minors in Sudan, Kenya and Uganda were changed to Nilotic.
-Added Berber to Libya and Tunisia to replace the "african minor" in these places. Berber (Tamazight) is often a spoken or official language.
-Cape Verde: Took it out from the "Macaronesia" state and put it together with Guinea-Bissau in a single state. The old "lower guinea" state was used, while the other two provinces of this state (Boffa and Timbo) are now part of the "Guinea" state. Terrain is now mountains.
-Renamed "Canned Food Factory" to Cannery.
-Changed Bali from Animist to Hindu.
-Added a 5-days delay for one of the events regarding Transvaal/Matabele to avoid potential crashes.
-Fixed Greece having Armenian as accepted.
-Added AFPG's missing Samoa flags. Kudos to AFPG for the flags.
-Stopped Western Sahara getting Moroccan cores as soon as the Berlin Conference happened.
-Stopped the "reorganize Benin" and the "Integrate Lithuania in the Baltic States" decisions from not disappearing after being taken.
-In order to avoid potential issues when checking religion, all countries have a flag to discriminate their religion. Adapted events/decisions that checked for religion to use the new system.
-Fixed assimilation in the new world being too slow due to an old leftover modifier.
-Restored vanilla values for literacy's influence on craftsmen promotion.
-Made easier for Bolivia and Peru to take the Native Protection Act. Changed the tech requirement for it.
-Fixed several problems with group modifiers in the pop_types file that were assimilating pops that shouldn't assimilate.
-Halved the prestige factor of dismantling forts/naval bases





### Discarded the following changes from HPM 0.3.8.4
-Renamed "Liquor" to "Beverages" and "Liquor Distillery" to "Bottling works". The good represents soft and 'hard' drinks. Removed Muslim-countries restrictions on it. 
-Made the "Turkish Tea" decision only add tea RGO to the black sea coast.
-Fixed Kamchatka having cores on Buryatia.
-Made sure that Sicily, Sardinia and Romagna lose cores if you use the "Avanti Italia" decision.
-Turkey won't get Azeri as accepted when using the "Greater Turkey" decision. 
-Removed Tarascan and Zapotec and they are all grouped together with Nahua, that was renamed to "Mesoamerican Indian".
-Removed the "african minor" and "North Caucasian Minor" cultures. The Abkhazians will be represented together with the Circassians but they are Orthodox. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians (The term "Circassian" sometimes includes the Abkhaz and Abaza people since they are originally related to the Adyghe)
-You will also need fruits for producing beverages.
-Eastern, Central and South Africa Changes:
    -Kenya: Kikuyu culture in Kenya was renamed Kikuyu?Kamba (Kamba and Kikuyu are Bantu from the same family) and it was expanded across the provinces occupied by the Kamba, the Meru and the Embu. The culture represents these people. Oromo in Kenya (representing the Borana Oromo) were changed to Coptic and moved from Garissa to the Ethiopian border. Maasai was renamed to Kalenjin-Maasai and they now extend through all of the Rift Valley Province.
    -[...] and a Northeast Bantu Culture (Guthrie J) to represent the people from these areas. 
    -Tanzania: Added the Kilombero Culture (Guthrie G). It extends to Comoros, Zanzibar and much of central Tanzania. 
	-Mozambique: Added a Nyasa culture (Guthrie N) that goes over Mozambique, Southern Tanzania and Zambia. 3 of 4 Mozambique States were reshaped to accommodate the changes. Changed a good part of the Yao people from Animists to Sunni. Yao was renamed to Yao-Makonde with the Makonde being the animists in the provinces.
	-Southern Africa: Added a 'Southern Bantu' culture, correspondent to Guthrie S.
    -Angola/Namibia: Mocamades now starts with a Herero majority and a Khoisan minority (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Angola_Ethnic_map_1970.svg ) Added a Kavango-Kimbundu Culture to Angola, Northern Namibia and Congo that represents Guthrie's Group H, R and K.
    -Added a Adamawa-Ubangi Culture to represent the main pops of the Central Africa Republic and surrounding region. Added a few Fulbe there. The culture is also spread to South Sudan, Cameron, the two Congos and Chad.
    -Added a Northwest Bantu group (Guthrie's groups A to D) that go over Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, parts of Cameroon and both Congos.
    -Added a Central Bantu group (Guthrie's groups L and M) that go over South DRC and Zambia.
	-Renamed the small Tiv group to Bantoid, which is a culture that spawns what used to be Tiv in Nigeria and the Bantoid languages of the Cameroonian Plateau, including the Tikar. They will be muslim in Bafoussam to represent the Bamum.
    -Renamed the Teda to Toubou. They represent a range of peoples in Chad, Libya, Niger and Sudan (Darfur). They will represent the "african minor" in these places.
    -African minor (slaves) in southern Chad are now represented by the Adamawa-branch of the Adamwa-Ubangi culture.
    -Renamed Sara to Sara-Baguirmi (seeing as they are from the same family and Baguirmi is almost extinct). The Baguirmi "slot" will now be used for the Maban (Biu?Mandara or Central Chadic), representing the minor and rather separatist cultures such as the Hadjarai, the Ouaddai and other minors.
Western and Northern Africa:
    -Niger: Merged the african minors to the Songhai in the Outer Hausaland State (Songhai representing here the Zarma people). In Kufe they were converted to Fulbe.
    -Mauritania: African minors were changed to Wolof, Fulbe and Berber where appropriate.
    -Changed the spelling of Toucouleur to Tukulor.
    -Mali: The african minor slaves in the sahara part of Mali were replaced by Maghrebi (representing the Hassaniya). Fixed numbers of the Fulbe a bit. African minors are now mostly Mande.
    -Nigeria: Added a Kwa group (East and West Congo-Benue Groups) to represent all minor cultures Nigeria and parts of Ghana and Benin.
    -Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo and Benin: Added a "Gur" culture representing all Gur languages, mainly centered in Burkina Faso.They also make the minorities in Northern Togo and Ghana as well as Benin. Spread the Senufo to Burkina and Mali.
	-Fixed proportion of pops and religion of pops in Guinea, Liberia, Guine-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast. African minors will now be represented by "Western Nigritic" in these places, representing the Atlantic branch of the Atlantic?Congo language group. Changed the Liberian event to occupy the countryside in a decision.
	-Gambia and Senegal: Fixed pops and religion, now the country won't be purely mande/african minor.
    -Total 8 more cultures compared to the previous version.
-Changes to genocide: Made pops prefer external emigration during genocide. Made so that any factor that might hamper a pop leaving a country will be null during a genocide. Primary/accepted-culture pops will lose a huge chunk of militancy during a genocide as long as at 70% of the pop is of the same ideology of the ruling party or a smaller chunk scaled to the proportion of the pop that is the same as the ruling party. Made so militancy/CON is given/reduced more reasonably depending on the party controlling the UH. The focus on killings will make closed borders operate at minimum efficiency during genocides.
-Removed the life rating and emigration push effects from the genocide modifier, but doubled the malus to immigrant attraction. Made the preparations_to_kill modifier kill immigrant attraction.












///////////////// UFH Version 0.0.0.1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\


### Integrated the following changes from HPM 0.3.7.1
-Changed province 12 - Reliance in Canada to Sado in Japan. It starts with around 25K pops, producing precious metals and under the Shogunate ownership. Numbers based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Japan_before_the_Meiji_Restoration#Former_provinces - Thanks go to the anon who gave the source. Pops come from the Nigata province, which used to encompass the island. Added Sado as a Treaty Port.
--Fixed a few (11) stray pixel clusters, added provinces (and names) to 35 lakes in South America, Australia, Africa and Asia.
-The Tanzimat Reforms now come with a one-year modifier to represent the Ottoman Land Code of 1858.
-Added an event for the Kanpur Massacre. The event can happen in any province with high militancy and primary pops from the colonial nation in India.
-Isolationist Uncivs will not be able to subside imports. Instead, they are forced to institute minimum tariffs, with protectionist countries locked at 95% minimum and free trade countries locked at 25% minimum.
-Added 1100 south German soldier pops to Nafplion to represent the Bavarian Troops in Greece. Added a starting unit that corresponds to these pops. Based on http://www.mwme.eu/essays/bavarian-greece/Haggenmueller_Intro/index.html
-Added a new Party Policy: Welfare policy. Pops don't care about it (as in, it's not an issue they vote for) and it's tied to the party ideology. Its effects the minimum and maximum spending in the Social slider. Socialist parties will push for a full welfare state, with communist and fascist parties adopting a paternalist policy and anarcho-liberals strongly opposing spending on welfare. Liberals, Reactionaries and Conservatives are unaffected.
-Stopped province 1421 - Madura from flipping to Rubber from Sulfur.
-Made being dismantled play a bigger role in unlocking fascist ideology.
-The "Claim the Levant CB" can't be used against GPs anymore, so after a GP takes a piece of the Levant from Egypt it will stay with them unless you justify a "place in the sun CB" against them.
-Reshaped Brescia, Tuscany, Siena, Rome (and surrounding provinces) to follow more natural boundaries such as rivers and be more aesthetic overall.
-Added the Apennines that extend from north to the south to the Italian peninsula. Redid the Terrain in the Italian lands and Corsica.
-Added an Atoll terrain. In the new terrain it's impossible to build railroads and the RGO size is extremely small. Changed a few of the islands in the pacific that corresponded to this terrain. Fixed a few wrong name placements in Polynesia.
-Changed the LR of Brindsi and Messina from 35 to 40 to better represent the growth in these regions.
-Reshaped Aquila, Foggia, Perugia and Ancona to better represent the terrain of the Italian peninsula. Province 10 - Inuvik was repurposed as Pescara in Italy and the old province is now part of 2598 - Fort Liard. Pops for the new province come from Aquila.
-Renamed province 2351 - La Plata to Magdalena. Added a decision to build La Plata that will rename the province.
-Added the French Alps: Grenoble and Digne changed from forest and farms to mountains. Reshaped Valence, Grenoble, Avignon, Toulon and Frejus to better fit with the terrain. Frejus and Toulun terrain changed from Farms to hills, to represent the last bits of the Alps.
-Added the Austrian Alps: Klagenfurt, Judenburg and Sankt Polten are now mountains.
-Sardinia now is completely hilly.
-Merged province 8 - Ross River into province 7 - Dawson. Province 8 is now Belluno in Italy. Changed Province 732 - Treviso from Iron to Timber and province 8 - Belluno from Timber to Iron.
-Fixed wrong brackets screwing the literacy setup of Italians in Austria.
-Changed LR in 827 - Zante and 843 - Chios from 30 to 35 and 32 respectively. Changed Ionian Islands literacy to be more in line with Greece, lowered plurality.
-Added a Setup for Greece, south germans will start with more literacy, Greece will start with a small baby boom for 4 years.
-Stopped Russia from being able to see the decision to integrate Lithuania in the UBD.
-Integrated 2669 - Amga in 2648 - Yakutsk. Now 2669 is Sondrio, in Italy.
-Moved the starting event about deciding if Crisis will be vanilla or not to a decision, under an umbrella of "optional" decisions. There's a few ways of tweaking the game through those decisions, but to avoid clutter, they all disappear in 1837 (and later on, in other start dates, they will disappear in a year).
-To make sure the "Sonno Joi" province event doesn't fire in case of a Tokugawa peaceful victory, now it requires any japanese-primary tag to be neighboring the country.
-Changed the name of the Australian Fascist Party.
-Using the decision to close borders requires Residency citizenship policy or a Fascist/Communist Dictatorship, meaning these governments can always take the decision.
-During the Senussi and the Algerian Rebellion, as well as the Bedr Khan Massacre, the spawned tags should be able to mobilize troops instead of being unable to fight. Senussi and Algeria should also start with Tuareg as accepted and a general. Changed a few pops to soldiers in Libya and Algeria so they can build a brigade. Fixed the Ottoman Empire getting the wrong CBs for the Senussi if they don't go immediately to war with them.
-Changed the adjective of the SGF from "German" to "South German", to keep consistency with the NGF.
-Changed Trinidad and Tobago and Trieste to Civilized status at the game start.
-Added option to Secularize society for Muslim nations. Non-secular Muslim countries cannot build Wineries or Distilleries and have the old "Islamic law" modifier as a triggered modifier. The Tanzimat Reforms secularize the Ottoman Empire.
-Renamed province 211 - Blackstone to Lynchburg.
-Fixed an issue with a decision that made the CSA capital move to province 211 - Lynchburg (old Blackstone) immediately.
-Fixed not being able to use the decision to integrate Lithuania in the UBD if the UBD owned Lithuanian cores.
-Changed Misri culture color to a darker shade of green by anon's suggestion.
-Health Care and Education reforms now give half of the bonus they used to give. The other half comes from a triggered modifier (that checks once per month) that triggers if administration/education has enough fund. The minimum amount for it to trigger is 20/30/40/50% Admin funding for Health Care and 30/40/50% Education funding for School reforms. Each reform level description has a text that tells you the minimum funding for the full bonus.
-Having the last Health Care reform and fully funding Administration will now give a bonus 0.02% for pop growth. Having the last School Reform and fully funding education will give a 0.10% bonus to education efficiency.
-Civilized nations with more than one state and more than 1 million pops have to invest a minimum in education if they don't want to lose literacy (through a triggered modifier). At 25% literacy you need to keep education spending at 10% at least. At 50% literacy you need to keep spending in 20% minimum and at 75% literacy the minimum is 30%.
-Removed old references to the "Islamic Law" modifier.
-Added a decision that turns Crete in a state for civilized powers in Europe.
-Updated the "Release Vassal" decisions.
-Added a set of decisions akin to NNM's "Release Vassal" decisions that allow you to return cores to individual countries, if they are your puppet or in your sphere. It doesn't return provinces that have your cores in them, though.
-Added a third option to the "Release Vassal" and the "Return Core" decisions to disable the decisions completely for the rest of the game. Useful if you don't plan to use them and just want to unclutter the decision tab.
-Halved all party loyalty in Switzerland, the UK and US. Now party loyalty at the game start doesn't go above 20% (previously 40%).
-When Transylvania joins (and becomes) Romania, it will lose Hungarian as accepted. Similarly when Panama joins the FRCA it will also lose North Andean as accepted.
-Added an event for the Serbian Constitution of 1838 and included Serbia in the liberal revolutions. Based on http://users.ox.ac.uk/~oaces/conference/papers/Bojan_Mitrovic.pdf
-Changed the Krakatoa event so it's not a major event anymore. It also doesn't kill 20% of the Bogor province (at the game start that would be 148K people) and now it kills 4% (around 36K people, game start values). It will also destroy a level of railroad and fort, if any are present in the province, as well as a level of the Naval Base in Batavia and it will reduce the Life Rating in Bogor by 1. Improved the event description a bit.
-Changed the Tunguska event so it's not a major event anymore, it doesn't change LR and it only kills pops if there's more than 10k pops in the province, but it completely wipes forts and railroads from the province. Improved the description a bit.
-Changed the San Francisco Earthquake event so it's not a major event anymore. It completely wipes forts, naval bases and railroads from the province and kills 2% of the population instead of the old 10% and it costs Åí50,000 for the owner of San Francisco. It also has a "devastation" modifier that will severely reduce province production (and hopefully close a few factories). Improved the description a bit.
-The UK will lose Irish as accepted when the Irish Republic Brotherhood event fires, to represent the rise of Nationalism in Ireland.
-Fixed a few instances of acquire_all_cores CB that would instantly white peace, like the '54-40 or fight' event for the US.
-Vassal countries that have vassals can no longer use the decisions to free vassals.
-Fixed a potential bug that happened if Egypt released the Levantine nations before the Oriental Crisis, which would end with the GPs declaring war on Egypt but instantly peacing out. Additionally, GPs will not declare war on Egypt if they don't own any Turkish cores.
-For clarity's sake, the hidden modifiers that affected pop migration that were associated with the last 3 Voting Franchise reforms are now directly tied to the reforms (and added to the old migration bonuses of these reforms, so Universal voting gave 5% immigrant attraction, now it gives 55% (5% + 50% of the old hidden modifier). The old GP bonus to immigrant attraction was moved from the pop files to the static modifiers. Both these changes don't change a thing in relation to immigrant attraction percentage, but they will make things more clear in regards to what reforms are important to attract immigrants and will hopefully help with performance.
-Secondary Powers now have a 5% bonus to immigrant attraction.
-Changes to pop immigration behavior: Capitalists will be 50% more likely to immigrate to L-F countries and 50% less likely to immigrate to countries with planned economy. Intellectuals don't care about general unemployment anymore when deciding where to migrate, they instead care about education funding (starting at 70% funding and ending at 100%, that gives between 10% to 50% bonus to immigrant attraction of these pops, depending on education funding), since they are paid by that slider. Same thing for soldiers and officers (with the military slider). What this means is that these pops will care more about how well paid they will be, since they will only be unemployed if they demote. Less than 40% funding will mean a -25% chance for these pops to pick the country.
-Instead of giving 1% bonus to immigration attraction, the "Underground Parties" reform will instead give -1%. The Harassment reform is now Neutral to immigrant attraction and the other reforms behave as vanilla.
-Stopped a few events that could change the UH/Voting/Electoral reforms during an election from happening during an election.
-Event 4420 - Cabinet Discusses War will not longer give a conquest CB on all neighboring countries, regardless if you can use it or not. Instead, it will only fire if you have a neighboring country with more than 1 state and it will give a single CB to acquire a state in a random neighboring country with more than 1 state.
-Similar to vanilla event 60140 where Liberal/Socialist force the "Appointed" UH Reform, when Socialists/Communists(not in a proletarian dictatorship) get to the UH and Trade Unions are illegal, they will force the "State Controlled" Trade Union reform (only if the country has Revolution and Counterrevolution researched).
-British Poor Strata will be way less likely to demand a change to the First Past the Post reform. Pops overall will care much less to change from FPTP until some basic reforms such as Free Press, Voting Rights and Meeting Rights have been acquired.
-Fixed a potentially serious vanilla bug where artisans didn't actually own their production (which may help to explain why they starved so much, though it seems they still got money somehow).
-Farmers, Laborers, Craftsmen and Clerks now care about Trade Union reforms (before that, no pops cared about those reforms) and will try to push for them. Craftsmen are the ones who care the most, followed by laborers, farmers and then clerks, who care the least. Socialism, unemployment, fulfilled life/everyday needs and CON are the main factors affecting this.
-Cleaned up the poptype files a bit, corrected a few mistakes.
-Added several Natural Disaster events, all relating to devastating earthquakes (and as a rule of thumb, for an earthquake to go in as an event, it either needs to be very destructive or cause a lot of casualties), namely the 1877 Iquique earthquake,  1868 Arica Earthquake, the 1896 Sanriku earthquake, the Great Ansei Earthquakes, the Great Neapolitan earthquake, the 1908 Messina earthquake.
-Fixed a wrong localization issue with the Enact Anaconda Plan for the CSA.
-Modified the Law of Return decision from Israel to correctly take out money instead of giving, fixing the events associated with it so it actually works how it was intended and to take into account open/closed border status, among other things. Changed the duration of the modifiers for the return of the diaspora pops from 2 to 5 years. Re-localized it so the decision can be used by Armenia too, if they want to bring back the Armenians from the diaspora. Differently from Israel, Armenia needs to be at least a SP to see the decision. The event structured was adapted from the source material a kind anon provided. The events for the law of return for Israel will also no longer increase the immigrating pops literacy.
-Correct a wrong flag for Canada.
-Added a Irredentist decision for  Israel.
-Made the German Namibia event in a decision, added tech requirements to it.
-When a nation asks for home rule, the country that gets the request will now lose the requesting country primary culture as an accepted culture, regardless of their answer.
-Instead of being completely immune to nations asking for home rule, the tags AUS, KUK, DNB and YUG will now get the requests (it was this way in NNM) but the AI will always reject it by default, so they will deal with unrest in the nations that ask for this. Considering the change of the above item, this also means tags like YUG and DNB can slowly lose accepted cultures. To deal with this, accepted cultures have more strict requirements when asking for home rule: they need high CON and MIL (more than 6-7) in a state as well as over 50% literacy. If the culture isn't accepted, just a bit of MIL (usually 2-3) and a bit of literacy (more than 25%) is needed, which is a requirement similar to before. This means that multicultural union tags will become more brittle and vulnerable to internal dissatisfaction, so a big focus should be in keeping everyone happy (or suppressed).
-Iceland won't ask home rule from Scandinavia anymore.
-Norway should declare independence before 1900 if Sweden stops being a Monarchy or if relations dip too low and CON is high. While they declare independence they will also fight for it if they get a "no", so it won't be a simple "refuse forever" case anymore. Sweden will lose Norwegian as accepted when the event happens.
-Condensed the Falklands/Malvinas renaming decisions in one decision (instead of 2) and removed the 2 prestige you could get from it.
-Fixed a possible issue that could end with the invest_in_irish decision being taken endlessly.
-Changed event 31100 about the discovery of Troy. Previously it always gave prestige to Turkey, now it depends on a GP (or SP in Europe/Levant) taking the decision to search for the Aegean civilizations and getting lucky. Added newspaper references that existed in Vanilla but weren't included because someone forgot to add a few lines to the event files. Reworked the event and newspapers text.
-Changed event 46800 about the discovery of Machu Picchu. Previously it always gave prestige to Peru, now it depends on a GP (or SP in the Americas) taking the decision to search for the city and getting lucky. For both events, High education spending and GP status increase the likelihood of discovery. The events give the same amount of prestige and require techs from the Social Thought tree, among other requirements. They become visible in 1850 and 1890 respectively, so players should have time to prepare for them. They are only visible if you fill the other conditions: being at least rank 3, having the owner of the Cusco/Canakkale in your sphere or being a GP/SP in the Americas for Machu Picchu or in Europe/Levant for Troy. This model will be follow for similar decisions/events.
-Fixed a few typos and improved a few descriptions in the events/news files.
-Founding the Suez Canal Company now also requires the business_banks tech.
-Fixed a few party names for Ireland. The Portuguese Fascist Party name was changed from "Estado Novo" to "Uniao Nacional". Yugoslavia's Fascists were renamed to ZBOR.
-To accommodate non fascist but highly authoritarian regimes, Presidential Dictatorships now can have a fascist party as the ruling party.
-Condensed the two decisions to rename Wallonia in a single one, made the description generic enough.
-Countries annexed through the Doctrine of Lapse and the Russian equivalent now can only be annexed once through it.
-The country that gets the Congo will now be left out of the free Scramble for Africa CBs.
-Lagos isn't needed anymore to form Nigeria, only one province in each of the 3 coastal states.
-Increased the effects of Autocracy/Tradition NVs on Conservative/Reactionary/Fascist/Communist ideology inclinations. Ideological inclinations from NVs will now only affect pops that are primary/accepted in a country. That means that greeks under the Ottoman Empire won't be more conservative just because they are in the Ottoman Empire. This means that in homogeneous countries with these NVs, they will gain more stability but multi-cultural countries will still be rocky by the ideology of the minorities.
-The provincia_cisplatina decision for Brazil now can be taken by an Absolute Monarchy with a Jingoist Party.
-Changed province 900 - Antakya from the Aleppo state to the Adana state.
-Checked and re-did all the pops in the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, Anatolia and the ME. Pops were changed so minorities always have the 4 basic pop types (farmers/laborers, intellectuals, soldiers and artisans) with additional 2 (aristocrats and officers) in capitals. This is done to avoid assimilation problems, no matter who owns the land. Pops now should always have a valid target to promote to. A few places like Bosnia and Aydin were missing soldier pops, sometimes even turkish soldiers (in the case of Aydin), so that's also fixed.
-Changed the whole of Ottoman Iraqi to colonial governments. This is done to reflect that Mamluk Rule in Baghdad ended only 5 years early, when they still ruled as an unciv with high (or almost complete) autonomy. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_R%C4%B1za_Pasha_(governor_of_Baghdad) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk_dynasty_(Iraq)
-To provide some access to Iraq, Dayr al-Zour will start under Ottoman Rule. This is done until I re-do provinces in the ME.
-EXPERIMENTAL: Disabled promotion on assimilation.
-Added new terrain types for the new world, for small islands and for the tundra/desert/boreal forests. This is made so these terrains don't have a huge RGO size just because they are in the new world and places like Hawaii can have more people than any place in the old world.
-Changed the "Christian Oppression" modifier for the Ottoman Empire so it doesn't give militancy and consciousness for non accepted pops. Instead, AI countries will each year take a decision to give militancy/CON to non Sunni pops in the Ottoman Empire. Previously, any non-turkish pops would get progressively get more pissed off, including the Muslims.
-Made the starting general for Tripoli a bit better.
-Removed the CON reduction in wartime that was inherited from NNM.
-Romanians, Albanians and pops in the Levantine and South Slav culture groups will be much more inclined to join nationalist/patriotic rebels than ideological rebels if they can IF they aren't accepted cultures and have a different religion from the state religion of the country.
-The decision to Annex Bosnia after the Berlin Conference now can be taken by any GP that owns Serbia and Southern Serbia or Croatia and Slavonia or Dalmatia.
-Reduced the LR in Togo from 15 to 10, made a decision to claim the place for Europeans GPs/SPs.
-Changed the citizenship_policy of the Ottoman Empire parties a bit so they have the whole spectrum of options supported and so pops don't end up always going for the same rebels.
-Added Party names for Greece and Serbia, based on a kind anon suggestions and http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Greece.html The "French Faction" (Ethniko Komma) are now the liberals and the British Party (Syntagmatiko Komma) are the conservatives. Previously, it was the other way around.
-Added better description to a few reforms.
-Reshaped several states in Siberia.
-Stop the decision for naming Lushun from being taking endlessly in certain situations.
-Renamed Buganda to Uganda.
-Stopped the "Independence for Tunisia" event from potential happening repeatedly. Now it only fires once.
-Liberia will now start with the "Developing Academia" Tech School.
-Added some missing Greek Pops to Crete.
-Fixed a wrong party name in Serbia.
-Made the Argentinian tags (SBA, ENT and CRT) non-releasable, to stop them from being released from the Argentine Confederation by war.
-Checked the Ottoman starting army and guaranteed none of the brigades start with missing pops. Reorganized the military to follow the historical organization. Based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_military_reforms#Reforms_of_Abd.C3.BClmecit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Army_(Ottoman_Empire)#Formations  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asakir-i_Mansure-i_Muhammediye and https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C4%9Fa_H%C3%BCseyin_Pa%C5%9Fa
-Added Turkish pops back to northern Iraq. They should be around 3% of the total population of Iraq, distributed in Mosul, Rewanduz and Sulaymania and 3% of Syria, distributed in Aleppo and Dayr al-Zour.
-Added a Turkmeneli tag to stop Turkish pops in Iraq and Syria from assimilating if the OT falls.
-Fixed the Greater California decision cores in Sonora.
-Made sure an event for the central Americans states don't fire against a country that doesn't exist.
-54'40 or fight event changed so it can fire if the US isn't a democracy.
-Stopped the decision to rename dutch wallonia from firing endlessly.
-Troy/Machu Picchu province owners now can take the decision to search for the city.
-Slight increase in Austrian Italy literacy for north Italians to (hopefully) make assimilation bug harder to happen.
-Changed the way the penalty to assimilation for accepted cultures with union tags in a province so it's significantly smaller, making the tooltip for assimilation easier to read. Also made it completely generic: any culture in a province with a core of a union tag that is accepted by said union tag will now count as "primary" for assimilation purposes (aka it will not assimilate).
-Added all pop types to Macao in 1836, so pops have where to promote.
-Reshaped Guangdong a bit to fix map artifacts.
-Removed event 16452. #event for USA to outlaw slavery or keep it after war with CSA apparently







### Discarded the following changes from HPM 0.3.7.1
-Renamed State GRE_837 from Attica to Central Greece.
-Decreased invention impact on demand from 0.1 to 0.06.	
-Fixed the localization in the event for German LR normalization and made it fire earlier, when Germany reaches 1895 levels of pops.
-Former colonial countries will now be released as uncivs and will have the option to civilize instantly on release (if they have 15% literacy) through a decision. If they do this, their informal status will be "semi-civilized". This means that they get a tech school that greatly reduces their research speed and can be reverted to Traditional Academia when they reach 25% literacy and have a few techs.		## added but changed to 10% and 20%






///////////// UFH Version 0.0.0.0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\

-Added HPM 0.3.6.2 as a base
-Made papal states white
