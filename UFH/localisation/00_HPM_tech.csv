schrapnel_standard_design;Schrapnel Standard Design;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
schrapnel_standard_design_desc;Shrapnel shells were anti-personnel artillery munitions which carried a large number of individual bullets close to the target and then ejected them to allow them to continue along the shell's trajectory and strike the target individually. They relied almost entirely on the shell's velocity for their lethality. The final shrapnel shell design bore little similarity to Henry Shrapnel's original design, marking the quick evolution of technology at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
barbed_wire_defense;Barbed Wire Defense;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
barbed_wire_defense_desc;Barbed wire is a type of steel fencing wire constructed with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strand. It is used to construct inexpensive fences and is used atop walls or as a major feature of the fortifications in trench warfare, stopping infantry charges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
helmet_mass_production;Helmet Mass Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
helmet_mass_production_desc;The use of artillery and modern machine guns renewed the need for steel helmets. They quickly became  the standard among armed forces, from the French Adrian and the British Brodie to the German Stahlhelm. By the 20th century, such helmets offered protection for the head from shrapnel and fragments as well as for specialist roles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
camouflage_uniforms;Camouflage Uniforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
camouflage_uniforms_desc;Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making the target hard to see, or by disguising them as something else. With the raise in mortality of modern warfare, it seemed prudent to make our soldiers harder to kill by replacing the traditional uniforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
rotary_kiln;Rotary Kiln;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rotary_kiln_desc;The Rotary "endless" kiln gives perfect control over combustion and produces a better grade of cement. The kiln is a cylindrical vessel, inclined slightly to the horizontal, which is rotated slowly about its axis. The material to be processed is fed into the upper end of the cylinder. As the kiln rotates, material gradually moves down towards the lower end, and may undergo a certain amount of stirring and mixing. Hot gases pass along the kiln, sometimes in the same direction as the process material, but usually in the opposite direction. The hot gases may be generated in an external furnace, or may be generated by a flame inside the kiln.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

stiff_plastic_brickmaking_machine_desc;In the machines used in the stiff-plastic process the previously powdered and screened clay is mixed into a stiff-plastic, granular material, which is afterwards compressed into a stiff paste. The mixing may be made in a trough-mixer or in a pug-mill. The shaping of bricks by the stiff-plastic process take places in two parts: the clot or roughly shaped brick which is made by mechanically forcing the stiff paste into a mould and the brick which is made by pressing the clot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

dobby_loom;Dobby Loom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dobby_loom_desc;A Dobby loom is a type of floor loom that controls all the warp threads using a device called a dobby. The main advantage of dobby looms is that more intricate designs can be produced. Dobby looms can be operated by wooden lags with pegs, which rotate around a roller above the loom. The pegs in the lags correspond to the lifting plan, which controls which harnesses are lifted. Punched paper pattern cards can also be used.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cotton_gin;Cotton Gin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cotton_gin_desc;The Cotton Gin is a machine for cleaning cotton of its seeds. The device pulls the cotton through a set of wire teeth mounted on a revolving cylinder, the fibre passing through narrow slots in an iron breastwork too small to permit passage of the seed. The simplicity of the invention — which could be powered by man, animal, or water — caused it to be widely copied despite patents. The cotton gin increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50. While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lancashire_loom;Lancashire Loom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lancashire_loom_desc; The Lancashire Loom is an self-acting loom, though it has to be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. The principal advantage of the Lancashire loom was that it was semi-automatic, when a warp thread broke the weaver was notified. When the shuttle ran out of thread, the machine stopped. An operative thus could work 4 or more looms whereas previously they could only work a single loom. Indeed the term A Four Loom Weaver was used to describe the operatives. Labour cost was quartered. In some mills an operative would operate 6 or even 8 looms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steam_powered_silk_reels;Steam-Powered Silk-Reels;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steam_powered_silk_reels_desc;Silk reeling is the process by which a number of cocoon baves are reeled together to produce a single thread. This is achieved by unwinding filaments collectively from a group of cooked cocoons at one end in a warm water bath and winding the resultant thread onto a fast moving reel. By mechanizing the process, we could increase our silk-reeling efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
