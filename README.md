This mod lets you kill all the niggers amongst other things
managed by the anarcho-syndicalist commune of v2g

please contribute whatever you want since this mod doesnt actually do anything yet



How to contribute:

- Download Github desktop
- Clone UFH from this repository
- Put your UFH repository on some folder like development/UFH or uhh something different from the V2 mods folder
- Keep github desktop open and do whatever changes you want to the repository as if you were changing a normal mod (so you'll probably be moving around files and changin them in Notepad++)
- Once you're happy with your changes you probably want to copy the mod and move it to your V2/mods folder to run tests
- If it all works, Github desktop will show all the changes you've made relative to the main branch
- Make a summary of your changes and explain what they are, then press commit
- Then you have to make a pull request, then I(or someone else with push permission) will merge it with the main/development branch
(Note: I will probably make another branch called "dev" or something where the actual development takes place, then the main branch will be for finished releases)
- Then you just keep making the changes you want and all of that; if you have push permission then I think you can just add it to the main branch straight up, but make sure to test it first and explain it properly or I might remove push permissions if people keep shitting up the mod on purpose

Will probably add pics soon if I ever figure out how to
