This mod lets you kill all the niggers amongst other things
managed by the anarcho-syndicalist commune of v2g

please contribute whatever you want since this mod doesnt actually do anything yet



How to contribute:

- Download Github desktop
- Clone UFH from this repository
- Put your UFH repository on some folder like development/UFH or uhh something different from the V2 mods folder
- Keep github desktop open and do whatever changes you want to the repository as if you were changing a normal mod (so you'll probably be moving around files and changin them in Notepad++)
- Once you're happy with your changes you probably want to copy the mod and move it to your V2/mods folder to run tests
- If it all works, Github desktop will show all the changes you've made relative to the main branch
- Make a summary of your changes and explain what they are, then press commit
- Then you have to make a pull request, then I(or someone else with push permission) will merge it with the main/development branch
(Note: I will probably make another branch called "dev" or something where the actual development takes place, then the main branch will be for finished releases)
- Then you just keep making the changes you want and all of that; if you have push permission then I think you can just add it to the main branch straight up, but make sure to test it first and explain it properly or I might remove push permissions if people keep shitting up the mod on purpose

Will probably add pics soon if I ever figure out how to


please PLEASe keep a complete version of your mod when doing changes and doing pull requests
what i mean is uh have everything you need for the mod to work, the common folder, history, gfx, etc. then just change around the shit you want to change
so uhhhhhh yeah just like dont have it so the only thing in your folder is decisions/kill_all_the_niggers.txt
